#+TITLE: Configuring Emacs

* Preface

I've always been a fan of ~org-babel~, even from before I used Emacs. Now I can finally document the whys and hows without tons of comments everywhere.

** Settings

I run the latest and greatest of Emacs (whatever that is) and that works for me.

* General settings

For settings that don't really belong in any specific category.

*** Name
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (setq user-full-name "Sondre Nilsen"
        user-mail-addres "nilsen.sondre@gmail.com")
#+END_SRC

*** Real estate
I don't need any of these as they just end up taking up my precious screen real estate.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (when window-system
    (tooltip-mode -1)
    (tool-bar-mode -1)
    (menu-bar-mode 1)
    (scroll-bar-mode -1))
#+END_SRC

*** Packages
Load Marmalade and Melpa for more packaging goodness.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
               '("marmalade" . "https://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
  (package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

And since I am going to be using ~use-package~ for installing and configuring packages as well, I need to make sure that is installed as well.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))
  (require 'use-package)
#+END_SRC

Furthermore, I want to automatically compile my emacs files.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package auto-compile
    :ensure t
    :config (auto-compile-on-load-mode))
  (setq load-prefer-newer t)
#+END_SRC
;; Automatically tangle a init.el file instead of reading from this file
;; Local Variables:
;; eval: (add-hook 'after-save-hook (lambda ()(org-babel-tangle)) nil t)
;; End:
