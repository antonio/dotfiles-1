* Preface
After having used ~org-babel~ to configure my Emacs settings, I just enjoyed it
so much that I've decided to redo all my dotfiles as literate programming
documents that will automatically create my dotfiles.

** Tmux
I discovered Tmux while using Vim, and it was love at first sight. I won't
claim I am a power user, not at all. I'm still having trouble with the whole
window/frames thing that Tmux uses. But just being able to have multiple "tabs"
open and doing very different tasks was awesome.
* General settings
