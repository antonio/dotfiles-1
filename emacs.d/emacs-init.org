#+Title: Emacs configuration

* My Emacs settings
  This is my emacs settings that are continously evolving... and I'm a newbie so I don't really know what I'm doing either.

** NOTE
   This file is automagically tangled into a =emacs-init.el= file so no editing that file.

* Core settings

** Make sure the path loads properly on OS X
   This depends on the [[https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell][exec-path-from-shell]] package so it will properly load the path.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (memq window-system '(mac ns))
    (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
#+END_SRC

* Appearance
  Now comes the time to make sure Emacs starts looking dashin'. These settings configure (in order)

** Bars, bars
   There's no need for the menubar/toolbar/scrollbar or splash screen so these are all hidden.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (if (fboundp 'menu-bar-mode) (menu-bar-mode -1))
  (if (fboundp 'tool-bar-mode) (tool-bar-mode -1))
  (if (fboundp 'scroll-bar-mode) (scroll-bar-mode -1))
  (setq inhibit-startup-message t)
#+END_SRC
