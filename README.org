* ~dotfiles~
These are my dotfiles. There are many like them but these ones are mine. They
are all written in Emacs' ~org-mode~ and are tangled to their specific files
with ~org-babel~. I decided to rewrite my dotfiles as literate configurations.
I started with Emacs, loved it and have now started rewriting most of my other
dotfiles in it as well.
* Applications
** Emacs
I am currently running the latest Emacs 25.1 pretest on OS X, downloaded with
Homebrew as ~brew install emacs --with-cocoa --with-gnutls --with-imagemagick
--devel~. My settings can be found in the [[https://github.com/sondr3/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs.org][~emacs.org~]] file.
** (Neo)vim
I have completely switched over to using Neovim as my daily Vim driver. I
install it as ~brew install neovim --HEAD~. My settings can be found in the
[[https://github.com/sondr3/dotfiles/blob/master/vim.org][~vim.org~]] file.
** Tmux
Initially I just used the tabs in ~iTerm2~ but found somewhere that Tmux was a
lot better. So I switched to it. This is also installed via Homebrew as ~brew
install tmux --HEAD~. Yes, I like breaking things. Again, my settings can be
found in [[https://github.com/sondr3/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux.org][~tmux.org~]].
** Terminal
I run the latest nightly beta version of ~iTerm2~. Whichever that is.
* Installation
I seriously recommend you to not use these for yourself. Find things in them
you like and steal those instead of just straight up copying these. They are
made for me and only me.
