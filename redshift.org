#+TITLE: Redshift settings

* Introduction

When I used macOS I always used a program called ~flux~ to adjust the colors on my
screen automatically according to the time of day and of the location of where
I'm at. This really helped with reducing strain on my eyes at night and was
something that I really enjoyed using. Luckily for me, it's available as
~redshift~ on Linux.

* Installation

Since I'm using Arch I simply ran ~sudo pacman -S redshift~, and that was that.

* Configuration

Redshift automatically reads it's settings from ~~/.config/redshift.conf~ at
launch so configuration goes there.

** Temperature settings

First we'll set the temperature that Redshift will use at night and day. The
defaults are ~5500~ at day and ~3500~ at night, which is slightly different from
~flux~ which uses neutral light at day (~6500~) and even more red at night (~2300~).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle "~/.config/redshift.conf"
  [redshift]
  temp-day=5500
  temp-night=3500
#+END_SRC

** Transition

Instead of having a hard transition where the screen just goes from neutral to
night temperature in a split second, we'll transition slowly over time to make
the transition less glaring.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle "~/.config/redshift.conf"
  transition=1
#+END_SRC

** Location provider

You could use the automatic location provider that's builtin, but it requires an
internet connection when the program starts and I'm fairly certain that my WiFi
starts later than Redshift, so it'd just crash out. Instead we'll manually
specify the location, which for the moment is Bergen.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle "~/.config/redshift.conf"
  location-provider=manual
#+END_SRC

** Adjustment method

I'm fairly certain that this is the default, but the Arch Wiki recommends using
the ~randr~ method of adjusting the screen.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle "~/.config/redshift.conf"
  adjustment-method=randr
#+END_SRC

** Location

And then we can set the coordinates for Bergen

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle "~/.config/redshift.conf"
  [manual]
  lat=60.39
  lon=5.33
#+END_SRC

* End

And that's it for configuring Redshift. The configuration for it's startup is
found in the ~xorg.org~ file.
